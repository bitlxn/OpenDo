# For Designers
This app is bult for designers, developers or game creators who want a todo list app that is easy to use and easy to customize. So most of us are games and thats why we have chosen the default theme of this app to be dark. We will make it so you can create your own theme and choose it from the settings page in the app. If you want to change the look and feel of the app you can contribute to the css in the .svelte files. We will also make it so you can create your own icons and choose them from the settings page in the app.
